commit_message = """building: osx: remove spurious MacOS/ prefix from CFBundleExecutable

Remove spurious MacOS/ prefix from CFBundleExecutable in the
generated Info.plist when building an app bundle. As discussed
in #4413 and #5442, the CFBundleExecutable should contain only
executable name.

Having the MacOS/ prefix causes the following warning to be shown
in macOS Console.app when the bundle is launched on macOS 10.14
Mojave (the later versions of macOS seem unaffected):

```
com.apple.xpc.launchd.domain.pid.<Application Name>.<PID>): Could
not resolve origin of domain. XPC services in this domain's bundle
will not be bootstrapped: error = 107: Malformed bundle,
taint = missing executable
```

Effectively reverts 6b99e01.

Fixes #5442.
Fixes #4413.
